## Brainstorm & Feature Ideas

Below are raw notes and feature ideas collected for the project. Keep these as a living list we can refine into tickets.

- Ideas?
- Register for classes automatically
- Clone api??? For something?
- Atrocious loading speeds

Productivity website
How would our website make life easier?

- Make your calendar automatic?
	- Scan webpage you're on, propose Title, Start/end time, Date, Location, Description
	- Able to respond to time conflicts (add functionality later)
	- Suggestive timeblocking: ask where you can fit an event in blank spaces; look for the most free day
	- Support repetitive schedules (e.g., create duplicate events like weekly pickleball)

- Scan Google Calendar and Gmail for database
- AI chatbot (Olama)
- Button / link to calendar

- Eject HTML to the website it's currently on

- Extension ideas:
	- Scan email, look for new events; popup: “Would you like to add this to your calendar? Move this around? Propose a time to add to your calendar?”
	- Voice API integration

- Button: "scan GMails from when?"

- Settings page on web app

- Parse Gmail (hypothetically Outlook)
- Copy/paste function to parse and create calendar entries
