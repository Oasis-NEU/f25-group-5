## 💡 Brainstorm & Feature Ideas

Below are raw notes and feature ideas collected for the project. Keep these as a living list we can refine into tickets.


🏗️ Productivity website — How would our website make life easier?

- 📆 Make your calendar automatic
  - 🌐 Scan webpage you're on, propose: Title, Start/end time, Date, Location, Description
  - ⚠️ Able to respond to time conflicts (add functionality later)
  - ⏱️ Suggestive timeblocking: ask where you can fit an event in blank spaces; find the most free day
  - 🔁 Support repetitive schedules (e.g., create duplicate events like weekly pickleball)

- 🔎 Scan Google Calendar and Gmail for database
- 🤖 AI chatbot (Gemini)
- 🔗 Button / link to calendar

- 📤 Inject HTML to the website it's currently on for the intergrated calender experience

- 🧩 Extension ideas:
  - ✉️ Scan email, look for new events; popup: “Would you like to add this to your calendar? Move this around? Propose a time to add to your calendar?”
  - 🗣️ Voice API integration

- 📅 Button: "scan GMails from when?"

- ⚙️ Settings page on web app

- 📨 Parse Gmail (hypothetically Outlook)
- 📋 Copy/paste function to parse and create calendar entries
