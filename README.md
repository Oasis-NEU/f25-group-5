## 💡 Brainstorm & Feature Ideas

Below are raw notes and feature ideas collected for the project. Keep these as a living list we can refine into tickets.


🏗️ Productivity website — How would our website make life easier?

- 📆 Make your calendar automatic
  - 🌐 Scan webpage you're on, propose: Title, Start/end time, Date, Location, Description
  - ⚠️ Able to respond to time conflicts (add functionality later)
  - ⏱️ Suggestive timeblocking: ask where you can fit an event in blank spaces; find the most free day
  - 🔁 Support repetitive schedules (e.g., create duplicate events like weekly pickleball)

- 🔎 Scan Google Calendar and Gmail for database
- 🤖 AI chatbot (Gemini)
- 🔗 Button / link to calendar

- 📤 Inject HTML to the website it's currently on for the intergrated calender experience

- 🧩 Extension ideas:
  - ✉️ Scan email, look for new events; popup: “Would you like to add this to your calendar? Move this around? Propose a time to add to your calendar?”
  - 🗣️ Voice API integration

- 📅 Button: "scan GMails from when?"

- ⚙️ Settings page on web app

- 📨 Parse Gmail (hypothetically Outlook)
- 📋 Copy/paste function to parse and create calendar entries

🧑‍💼 DELEGATE TASKS

- gmail context + gmail event parser
    provide context to the chat bot by parsing gmail via google's gmail api ( we could also use outlook api) to find intresting events to sugest the user to attend. 
- canvas context
    provide context to the chat bot by giving assigment due dates via the instructure canvas API
- google calender context 
    provide context to the chat bot by ethier looking at html of the current page ( we can do this because the chat bot only gets used in the google calender website) or use google's calender API to see the users existing events and provide this information to the chat bot
- chat bot 
    use google gemini (because free). user can freely chat with the bot and ask it questions. the bot takes in all the context we gathered from calender, gmail and canvas to give the user more relevent respoces. 

    also the bot not only should be able to respond via chat but also respond via giveing calender sugestions 
- crome extention UI
    add the pretty UI pannel to google calender website ( via crome extention content injection) where the user can interact with the chat bot.
- data base 
    to store chat history so the bots memory is not wiped every time you reload the site
-
